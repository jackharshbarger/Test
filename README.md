# Test
this the first one that i be created
having fun trying to figure out what this is all about.
I want to change the world, this the first step to doing it. 
taking everything one step at a time, making less mistakes every day. 
Being someone who makes others happy and can impact the world on a large scale
its hard for me to work hard, but each day I feel myself getting more and more focused. 
Still got a long journey ahead of us, but I want to feel more comfortable reaching out and getting help
All I want to do is help, but I feel scared not being someone who people value, which I guess is stupid, everyone has value.
Everyone has the ability to showcase what they have to offer to society, it's just giving them the platform
As soon as people feel like their message is being heard, they become instantly happier
If I have to be the one who gives people the platform, but doesn't get heard
So be it, As long as I leave this world better than what it was 
I will have felt like I have done my service
This the life I created.
